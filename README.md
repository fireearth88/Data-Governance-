# Journey of Implementing Data Governance Model
### Maturing Progress

The journey commenced with an evaluation of the existing data management framework, leading to the identification of critical gaps and opportunities. 
Our comprehensive Data Governance strategy has since focused on data quality, compliance and usability, with an empahasis on stakeholder collaboration across departments. 

As we iteratively rolled out the Data Governance initatives, we prioritized the establishment of various Data Governance roles (i.e. Data Owners, Data Stewards, Data Custodians, etc), data lineage tracking and metadata management. The aim was was not just to ensure data quality and compliance but also to enhance decision-making capabilities across the organization. 

We have made significant strides in our Data Governance maturity model, moving from an initial ad-hoc state to a more managed and optimized environment
