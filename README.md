# What is Data Governance?

### Bringing data under control and keeping it secure and consistent with rules, processes and accountability that allow the organization to better manage the availability, usability, security and integrity of the corporate data sources.

### Using an analogy to drive key concepts around Data Governance

Think of Data Governance as the blueprint before reconstructing a modern house, deculttering and organizing a long-inhabited family home for over three decades.

### Step 1: Discovery
Sorting through everything was like embarking on a treasure hunt; it wasn't just about identifying what's there but also discovering hidden gems or challenges.

In the data world, this initial step is known as Data Discovery. It's about cataloging all the different types of data you hold, whether stored on local servers, in the cloud, or even in third-party software as a service (SaaS) applications. Easy enough for data you're aware of, but the real trick lies in uncovering the data you don't even know you have.

### Step 2: Classification
Once I had sifted through each room of my family home, the next step was categorization. Whether it was nostalgic photos, ancient toys, or crucial financial documents, everything had to be sorted.

Similarly, in data governance, this is the Classification stage. It involves tagging each data set—be it customer information, product metrics, or financial statements—with a relevant label to make future reference more streamlined.

### Step 3 & 4: Policy & Rules
After sorting came decision-making. My family and I set guidelines for what to keep, donate, or discard. For example, toys missing parts were donated in the hope they'd find new life elsewhere. This act of laying down the law in the data universe is Policy and Rules Enforcement. For instance, all personally identifiable information (PII), like Social Security numbers, must be obscured or masked as per the rule that helps enforce this policy.

### Step 5: Metadata (i.e. Sorting and Labeling)
What came next was reorganizing what I chose to keep, storing them in well-labeled bins.

In the data world, this is analogous to Metadata, which serves as a "table of contents" for your data assets. It tells you what the data is, where it came from, and how it can be used—akin to a library's card catalog describing a book.

Finally, just as some items in the home could be sold for value, effective data governance reveals valuable data assets that could be monetized. And while you can't automate house clearing, the data world offers the luxury of automation to keep everything under control, secure, and consistent.

This captures the essence of data governance: bringing data under control while ensuring it's secure, consistent, and potentially valuable to the organization.

### The dimensions of data quality


# Principles for Data Governance
The diagram (i.e. source:KIK Consulting) below shows how a policy can be built upon from the core principles that are supported by the dimensions of data quality.

To faciliate easy recall, each primciple is paired with a catchy phrase, presented in adjacent bubbles to KISS (i.e. Keep It Simple & Straighforward) the Data Governance concepts, in articulating the objectives of a long-lasting Data Governance program. 

## Principle 1: Data must be recognized as a valued & strategic enterprise asset.

### Tagline - Transitioning From "My Data" to "Our Data"

#### Justification:
Data serves as an invaluable asset to the organization. 
Accurate, timely data are the critical foundation for effective decision-making and customer service at the company.

#### Consequences: 
To maintain the integrity of this asset, it's crucial to meticulously manage data. This involves ensuring clear definitions, appropriate access, and proper controls. Both the management and the staff should be able to depend on data's accuracy and have access to it whenever and wherever it is necessary.

## Principle 2: Data must have clearly defined accountability.

### Tagline - "Data Governance: A Collective Duty"

#### Justification:
Data often possesses organizational value that transcends the scope of any single application. The company needs data to be available for enterprise-wide sharing and integration, in compliance with existing security and privacy policies. To facilitate sharing, the data must be clearly defined and its meaning should be universally understood across the enterprise.

Broadening data accessibility contributes to more efficient and effective decision-making, while also enabling swift responses to informational requests and the delivery of services.

#### Consequences: 
By embracing shared data, the company can enhance decision-making quality. Maintaining a singular, reliable data source is more cost-efficient than managing multiple, inconsistent datasets. Data will be more in line with cross-departmental needs, and discrepancies in data syntax and semantics between different databases will be reduced. Applications will also be more easily portable. Furthermore, changes in data management can be implemented with minimal disruption to existing applications, adapting to evolving requirements or conditions.

To ensure data security, safeguards against unauthorized usage and disclosure must be in place. This involves implementing specific processes, protocols, and automated techniques. Access to data should only be made via well-defined interfaces to guarantee its correct understanding and utilization.

For successful data sharing, the Data Governance Team, Data Domain Stewards, and business sectors must collectively establish, adhere to, and disseminate a uniform set of definitions, policies, and standards. Standardized definitions serve as the bedrock for system interfaces and data exchanges, and a common lexicon amplifies the value of these definitions.

## Principle 3: Data must be managed to follow internal & external rules.

### Tagline - Avoid Risk & Compliance Issues

#### Justification:
Existing laws and regulations mandate the protection, security, and privacy of personally identifiable information. While fostering open data sharing and controlled accessibility, it's crucial to also limit the exposure of restricted, confidential, or sensitive data.
Data Domain Stewards, acting as Data Owners, are responsible for maintaining data quality, defining data attributes, ensuring security and privacy, standardizing data, and overseeing its proper use within their domain.

#### Consequences: 
For enhanced data quality and value, as well as risk and compliance mitigation, clear rules and accountabilities for data definition, creation, and utilization must be established, managed, and communicated.

The Data Governance Team is tasked with documenting and disseminating information about roles and responsibilities across the organization.

The Data Governance Team must collaborate with various business sectors to make sure that applicable laws and regulations are documented and communicated to the relevant departments.

## Principle 4: Data quality must be defined & managed consistently across the data life cycle.

### Tagline - "Get It Right, From Start to Finish"

#### Justification:
The quality standards for data must be well defined to be able to identify, record, measure, and report the quality of the data.

The quality standards will focus on measuring business process and decision-making improvements from complete, relevant, and unique data.

Enterprise-critical data must be tested against the standards consistently across the Enterprise, with understood standards available to all data definers, producers, and users.

Data Owners, in the role of Domain Stewards, are accountable for data standard definitions and appropriate use of the standards for data in their domain.

#### Consequences: 
To improve data quality, the Data Governance Team, with the cooperation of the Data Domain Stewards and the business areas, must develop, abide by, and communicate a common set of standards.

Common data standards are the foundation for quality systems interfaces and data use. A common place to record data standards will increase ability to improve the quality of the data.

# Journey of Implementing Data Governance Model
### Maturing Progress

The journey commenced with an evaluation of the existing data management framework, leading to the identification of critical gaps and opportunities. 
Our comprehensive Data Governance strategy has since focused on data quality, compliance and usability, with an empahasis on stakeholder collaboration across departments. 

As we iteratively rolled out the Data Governance initatives, we prioritized the establishment of various Data Governance roles (i.e. Data Owners, Data Stewards, Data Custodians, etc), data lineage tracking and metadata management. The aim was was not just to ensure data quality and compliance but also to enhance decision-making capabilities across the organization. 

We have made significant strides in our Data Governance maturity model, moving from an initial ad-hoc state to a more managed and optimized environment
